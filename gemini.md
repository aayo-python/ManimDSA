You're looking for questions that push the boundaries of graph algorithms, venturing into complex, often NP-hard, or highly specialized areas. These problems often require a deep understanding of multiple algorithmic paradigms and creative problem-solving.

Here are 30 very hard graph algorithm questions:

(Focus on approximation algorithms and heuristics, as exact solutions are often intractable for large instances).

Maximum Clique Problem: Find the largest clique (a subset of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge) in a given graph.
Minimum Vertex Cover Problem: Find a minimum set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in this set.

This can be mapped to graph problems, e.g., finding a minimum set of nodes to "cover" all edges or other nodes.
Maximum Cut Problem: Partition the vertices of a graph into two sets such that the number of edges connecting vertices in different sets is maximized.

### Advanced Flow, Matching, and Connectivity

Min-Cost Max-Flow: Find a flow from source to sink that has maximum value while minimizing the total cost, given costs associated with flow through edges.

Sparse Graph Algorithms: Design algorithms that exploit the sparsity of graphs (e.g., graphs with O(V) edges) to achieve better time complexity than general graph algorithms.
Matching with Additional Constraints: Beyond maximum bipartite matching, consider problems like stable matching, minimum weight perfect matching in general graphs, or maximum matching in non-bipartite graphs.
Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems: Design and analyze algorithms that find near-optimal solutions for problems like TSP, Vertex Cover, or Set Cover, often with performance guarantees.
Feedback Vertex Set: Find a minimum set of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic.
Shortest Common Supersequence (Graph variant): Given a set of paths in a graph, find the shortest path that contains all given paths as subsequences.
Maximum Independent Set (Maximum Stable Set): Find the largest set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.

Dynamic Graph Algorithms for Specific Problems: For example, maintaining shortest paths or connected components as edges are added or removed, or supporting online queries.
These questions demand a strong grasp of fundamental graph theory, algorithmic design techniques (dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, branch and bound, network flow), and often require familiarity with advanced data structures. They are frequently encountered in competitive programming, advanced algorithm courses, and research.
