2. Construction using Inorder and Postorder

inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]
root = build_tree(preorder, inorder)

```
[4/26, 16:11] Meta AI: Here's an explanation of Prim's algorithm:

What is Prim's Algorithm?
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph.

How Does Prim's Algorithm Work?
1. *Initialization*: Choose an arbitrary node as the starting node.
2. *Grow the Tree*: At each step, select the minimum-weight edge that connects a node in the tree to a node not yet in the tree.
3. *Add the Edge*: Add the selected edge to the tree.
4. *Repeat*: Repeat steps 2-3 until all nodes are included in the tree.

Example Code
```
import heapq

def prim(graph):
    mst = []
    visited = set()
    edges = [(0, None, 0)]  # (weight, parent, node)
    while edges:
        weight, parent, node = heapq.heappop(edges)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        if parent is not None:
            mst.append((parent, node, weight))
        for neighbor, neighbor_weight in graph[node].items():
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(edges, (neighbor_weight, node, neighbor))
    return mst

Example usage:
graph = {
    0: {1: 2, 3: 6},
    1: {0: 2, 2: 3, 3: 8, 4: 5},
    2: {1: 3, 4: 7},
    3: {0: 6, 1: 8, 4: 9},
    4: {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 9}
}

mst = prim(graph)
print(mst)
```

Time Complexity
The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

Space Complexity
The space complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

        elif char == '(':
            stack.append(char)

[4/26, 17:48] Meta AI: Here are solutions to LRU Cache problems:

What is LRU Cache?
LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache is a data structure that stores a limited number of items. When the cache is full and a new item needs to be added, the least recently used item is removed.

Implementing LRU Cache
- *Approach*: Use a dictionary and a doubly linked list to implement the LRU Cache.
- *Code*:
```
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            value = self.cache.pop(key)
            self.cache[key] = value
            return value
        return -1

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.pop(key)
        elif len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)
        self.cache[key] = value
```

Using Python's Built-in OrderedDict
- *Approach*: Use Python's built-in OrderedDict to implement the LRU Cache.
- *Code*:
```
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
            return self.cache[key]
        return -1

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)
```

Time Complexity
- *Get*: O(1)
- *Put*: O(1)

Space Complexity
- *Cache*: O(capacity)
